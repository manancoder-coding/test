# TweetGenerator - UNICEF
This software converts your multimodal content (youtube videos or blog posts) into a tweet or thread so you easily can automate with Twitter / X.com. With this, you save time and money in terms of Social Media Managment.

In this case, I generate automatically content from UNICEF articles, youtube videos and medium blog posts.

# Inspiration
This idea comes from this [amazing project from LangChain](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langtweet)
